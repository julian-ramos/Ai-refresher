# Ai-refresher

This repository is a bunch of links with key information to review the basics of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. Links marked as Cheat sheets do not have any in deep review however present the key ideas and are a good starting point for deciding which topics to review in depth.

### Statistics 
The null hypothesis involves the absence of a difference or the absence of an association. For classification: Positive is the alternative hypothesis, Negative is the Null hypothesis.

**Type I error**

Rejection of a true null hypothesis as the result of a test procedure. False positive.

**Type II error**

Failure to reject a false null hypothesis. False negative.
